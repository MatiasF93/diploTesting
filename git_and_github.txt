Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
While Git takes care of the underlying version control, GitHub is the collaboration platform built on top of it. GitHub is the place for pull requests, comments, reviews, integrated tests, and so much more.
